# Python_Codes
Pyhton Codes I wrote on Jupyter for a data analytics (data immersion) course at CareerFoundry
## Project Description
**Imaginary Scenario:** _You’re an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates
through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more
information about their sales patterns. Your task is to perform an initial data and exploratory
analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better
segmentation based on the provided criteria._
## Key Questions Answered using Python Coding
1. The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day
are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times
when there are fewer orders.
2. They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend
the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
3. Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use
simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
4. Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product
orders.
5. The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
5.1. What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
often do they return to Instacart)?
5.2. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
5.3. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
5.4. Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
6. What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age?
Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
7. What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?
Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are
ordering, and anything else you can think of.
## Data Sets
I used a number of open-source data sets from Instacart as well as a fabricated customers datasetn for the purpose of this Project.

## Descriptions of Folders
- **01_Project_Management:** This folder contains the Project Brief (business questions related to the project, analysis, expectations etc.)
- **02_Data:** This folder contains the original datasets as well as Prepared Datasets after wrangling, cleaning and consistency checks, newly derived variables, and combined into one final dataset. The prepared datasets were exported after each step was completed.
- **03_Scripts:** This folder contains all my Jupyter Scripts with Python Codes necessary to complete the project.
- **04_Analysis:** This folder contains all visualisations created with Python to support the analysis and to derive insights.
- **05_Sent_to_Client:** This folder contains the final report that explains the whole process of how the datasets were wrangled, cleaned, the analysis, visualisations, answers to the key questions and recommendations for the marketing team.
